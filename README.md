# bjj_deals
Web scraper that pulls the daily deals from <a href="https://bjjfanatics.com/">bjjfanatics.com</a>. 

This is a little project that I've been working on as I teach myself Python. It uses <a href="https://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a> to crawl bjjfanatics.com's <a href="https://bjjfanatics.com/collections/daily-deals">daily deals</a> 
and uses <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> to store the results in a .db file.

For deploying your scraper, I recommend <a href="https://www.zyte.com/">Zyte</a>, which makes it fast and easy to get up and running.
