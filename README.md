# bjj_deals
Web scraper that pulls the daily deals from <a href="https://bjjfanatics.com/">bjjfanatics.com</a>. 

This is a little project that I've been working on as I teach myself Python. It uses <a href="https://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a> to crawl bjjfanatics.com's <a href="https://bjjfanatics.com/collections/daily-deals">daily deals</a> 
and uses <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> to store the results in a .db file.

As of now, this has to be run manually. I'm working on adding automation and email alerts.
